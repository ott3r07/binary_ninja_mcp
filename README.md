# Binary Ninja MCP

![Binary Ninja MCP Logo](images/logo.png)

This repository contains a Binary Ninja plugin, MCP server, and bridge that enables seamless integration of Binary Ninja's capabilities with your favorite LLM client.

## Features ✨

- ⚡ Seamless, real-time integration between Binary Ninja and MCP clients
- 🧠 Enhanced reverse engineering workflow with AI assistance
- 🤝 Support for every MCP client (Cline, Claude desktop, Roo Code, etc)
- 🗂️ Multi-binary supported: open multiple binaries and switch the active target automatically by the LLMs — no restart required

## Examples 🎬

### Solving a CTF Challenge

You can also watch the demo video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ffMHH39L_M).

## Components 🧩

This repository contains two separate components:

1. A Binary Ninja plugin that provides an MCP server that exposes Binary Ninja's capabilities through HTTP endpoints. This can be used with any client that implements the MCP protocol.
2. A separate MCP bridge component that connects your favorite MCP client to the Binary Ninja MCP server. While Claude Desktop is the primary integration path, the MCP server can be used with other clients.

HTTP endpoints

- `/allStrings`: All strings in one response.

- `/formatValue?address=<addr>&text=<value>&size=<n>`: Convert and set a comment at an address.
- `/getXrefsTo?address=<addr>`: Xrefs to address (code+data).
- `/getDataDecl?name=<symbol>|address=<addr>&length=<n>`: JSON with declaration-style string and a hexdump for a data symbol or address. Keys: `address`, `name`, `size`, `type`, `decl`, `hexdump`. `length < 0` reads exact defined size if available.
- `/hexdump?address=<addr>&length=<n>`: Text hexdump aligned at address; `length < 0` reads exact defined size if available.
- `/hexdumpByName?name=<symbol>&length=<n>`: Text hexdump by symbol name. Recognizes BN auto-labels like `data_<hex>`, `byte_<hex>`, `word_<hex>`, `dword_<hex>`, `qword_<hex>`, `off_<hex>`, `unk_<hex>`, and plain hex addresses.
- `/makeFunctionAt?address=<addr>&platform=<name|default>`: Create a function at an address (idempotent if already exists). `platform=default` uses the BinaryView/platform default.
- `/platforms`: List all available platform names.
- `/binaries` or `/views`: List managed/open binaries with ids and active flag.
- `/selectBinary?view=<id|filename>`: Select active binary for subsequent operations.
- `/data?offset=<n>&limit=<m>&length=<n>`: Defined data items with previews. `length` controls bytes read per item (capped at defined size). Default behavior reads exact defined size when available; `length=-1` forces exact-size.
- `/getXrefsToEnum?name=<enum>`: Enum usages by matching member constants.
- `/getXrefsToField?struct=<name>&field=<name>`: Xrefs to struct field.
- `/getXrefsToType?name=<type>`: Xrefs/usages related to a struct/type name.
- `/getTypeInfo?name=<type>`: Resolve a type and return declaration and details.
- `/getXrefsToUnion?name=<union>`: Union xrefs/usages (members, globals, refs).
- `/localTypes?offset=<n>&limit=<m>`: List local types.
- `/strings?offset=<n>&limit=<m>`: Paginated strings.
- `/strings/filter?offset=<n>&limit=<m>&filter=<substr>`: Filtered strings.
- `/searchTypes?query=<substr>&offset=<n>&limit=<m>`: Search local types by substring.
- `/renameVariables`: Batch rename locals in a function. Parameters:
  - Function: one of `functionAddress`, `address`, `function`, `functionName`, or `name`.
  - Provide renames via one of:
    - `renames`: JSON array of `{old, new}` objects
    - `mapping`: JSON object of `old->new`
    - `pairs`: compact string `old1:new1,old2:new2`
          Returns per-item results plus totals. Order is respected; later pairs can refer to earlier new names.

## Prerequisites

- [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/)
- Python 3.12+
- MCP client (those with auto-setup support are listed below)

## Installation

Please install the MCP client before you install Binary Ninja MCP so that the MCP clients can be auto-setup. We currently support auto-setup for these MCP clients:

    1. Cline (Recommended)
    2. Roo Code
    3. Claude Desktop (Recommeded)
    4. Cursor
    5. Windsurf
    6. Claude Code
    7. LM Studio

After the MCP client is installed, you can install the MCP server by **Binary Ninja plugin manager** or **manually**. Both methods support the MCP clients auto setup.

If your MCP client is not set, you should install it first then try to reinstall Binary Ninja MCP.

### Binary Ninja Plugin Manager

You may install the plugin through Binary Ninja's Plugin Manager (`Plugins > Manage Plugins`). When installed via the Plugin Manager, the plugin resides under:

- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Binary Ninja/plugins/repositories/community/plugins/fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp`
- Linux: `~/.binaryninja/plugins/repositories/community/plugins/fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Binary Ninja\plugins\repositories\community\plugins\fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp`

### Manually Install

To manually install the plugin, this repository can be copied into the [Binary Ninja plugins folder](https://arc.net/l/quote/ghhybrfz).

## Manually Setup MCP Client

**You do NOT need to set this up manually if you use the supported MCP client and follow the installation steps before.**

You can also manage MCP client entries from the command line:

```bash
python scripts/mcp_client_installer.py --install    # auto setup supported MCP clients
python scripts/mcp_client_installer.py --uninstall  # remove entries and delete `.mcp_auto_setup_done`
python scripts/mcp_client_installer.py --config     # print a generic JSON config snippet
```

For other MCP clients, this is an example config:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "binary_ninja_mcp": {
            "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/Binary Ninja/plugins/repositories/community/plugins/fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp/.venv/bin/python",
            "args": [
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/Binary Ninja/plugins/repositories/community/plugins/fosdickio_binary_ninja_mcp/bridge/binja_mcp_bridge.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Note: Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO` with the actual absolute path to your project directory. The virtual environment's Python interpreter must be used to access the installed dependencies.

## Usage

1. Open Binary Ninja and load a binary
2. Click the button shown at left bottom corner
3. Start using it through your MCP client

You may now start prompting LLMs about the currently open binary (or binaries). Example prompts:

### CTF Challenges

```txt
You're the best CTF player in the world. Please solve this reversing CTF challenge in the <folder_name> folder using Binary Ninja. Rename ALL the function and the variables during your analyzation process (except for main function) so I can better read the code. Write a python solve script if you need. Also, if you need to create struct or anything, please go ahead. Reverse the code like a human reverser so that I can read the decompiled code that analyzed by you.
```

### Malware Analysis

```txt
Your task is to analyze an unknown file which is currently open in Binary Ninja. You can use the existing MCP server called "binary_ninja_mcp" to interact with the Binary Ninja instance and retrieve information, using the tools made available by this server. In general use the following strategy:

- Start from the entry point of the code
- If this function call others, make sure to follow through the calls and analyze these functions as well to understand their context
- If more details are necessary, disassemble or decompile the function and add comments with your findings
- Inspect the decompilation and add comments with your findings to important areas of code
- Add a comment to each function with a brief summary of what it does
- Rename variables and function parameters to more sensible names
- Change the variable and argument types if necessary (especially pointer and array types)
- Change function names to be more descriptive, using vibe_ as prefix.
- NEVER convert number bases yourself. Use the convert_number MCP tool if needed!
- When you finish your analysis, report how long the analysis took
- At the end, create a report with your findings.
- Based only on these findings, make an assessment on whether the file is malicious or not.
